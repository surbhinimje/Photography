            <h2>What Is Photography?</h2>
            <p>
                Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.
                Color photography started to become popular and accessible with the release of Eastman Kodak’s “Kodachrome” film in the 1930s. Before that, almost all photos were monochromatic – although a handful of photographers, toeing the line between chemists and alchemists, had been using specialized techniques to capture color images for decades before.

            <h2>Do You Need a Fancy Camera?</h2>
            <p>
                Many people today believe that their phone is good enough for most photography, and they have no need to buy a separate camera. And you know what? They’re not wrong. For most people out there, a dedicated camera is overkill.
                Phones are better than dedicated cameras for most people’s needs. They’re quicker and easier to use, not to mention their seamless integration with social media.
                That advice may sound crazy coming from a photographer, but it’s true. If you have any camera at all, especially a cell phone camera, you have what you need for photography. And if you have a more advanced camera, like a DSLR or mirrorless camera, what more is there to say? Your tools are up to the challenge. All that’s left is to learn how to use them.

            <h2>What Is the Bare Minimum Gear Needed for Photography?</h2>
            <p>
               <strong>Camera :</strong> If you buy a dedicated camera (rather than a phone), pick one with interchangeable lenses so that you can try out different types of photography more easily.<br><br>                
               <strong>Lenses :</strong> For portrait photography, pick a prime lens (one that doesn’t zoom) at 35mm, 50mm, or 85mm. For sports, go with a telephoto lens. For macro photography, get a dedicated macro lens.<br><br>         
               <strong>Post-processing software :</strong> One way or another, you need to edit your photos. It’s ok to start with software already on your computer, or software that comes with your camera. But in the long run, a dedicated program will do a better job.

            <h2>The Three Fundamental Camera Settings You Should Know</h2>
            <p>
                The three most important settings are called shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. All three of them control the brightness of your photo, although they do so in different ways. In other words, each brings its own “side effects” to an image. So, it’s a bit of an art to know exactly how to balance all three for a given photo.<br>
                <ol type="1" class="listf">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shutter speed:</strong> The amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to the outside world while taking a picture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Aperture:</strong> Represents a “pupil” in your lens that can open and close to let in different amounts of light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ISO:</strong> similar to the sensitivity of film for taking pictures in different lighting conditions. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
